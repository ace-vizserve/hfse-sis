# HFSE SIS — Claude Instructions

A Student Information System for HFSE International School, Singapore. Modules — Markbook, Attendance, Evaluation, P-Files, Records, Admissions, SIS Admin — are surfaces of one student record, not sibling apps. The module switcher moves between them; `studentNumber` is the backbone.

## Stable rules — auto-loaded (every session)

These two are `@`-imported so they're always in context. Do not edit without explicit user approval.

## Stable rules — on-demand (read with the Read tool when relevant)

Not `@`-imported. Each file carries YAML frontmatter (`description`, `load: on-demand`) explaining its trigger. Read before acting when any of the "Read when..." conditions apply.

| Rule                              | Read when...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## Session context

<!--
Scratch surface for session-learned context, temporary caveats, in-flight
investigations. Safe to edit; pruned periodically. Stable rules do NOT go
here — they live in `.claude/rules/*.md`. Sprint-by-sprint history lives in
`docs/sprints/development-plan.md` + `git log`.
-->

**Current state (2026-07-30 — pushed to `origin/main` @ `5fe9fedc`):** Bug-fix batch across four surfaces, all on main; **new KD #163/#164/#165**, **migration 100 applied**. **(1) Attendance register was readable by any teacher** (KD #163) — `/attendance/[sectionId]` + `/summary` had NO assignment check while reading marks via the service client, so RLS never applied; a subject teacher saw the full register, an unassigned teacher saw live term stats. Both now gate per SECTION via `loadClassroomAccess` + `canReadAttendance`; the `.xlsx` export tightened from any-assignment to form-adviser. Knock-on: `/markbook/sections` row-menu cross-links now capability-gated (the KD #159 nav test walks nav items only, not row actions). **(2) Report card was pinned to Term 1** (KD #164), hiding every T2/T3 adviser comment — an `is_current`-only lookup with `?? 1`, plus an "Interim (T1–T3)" pill hardcoded to `?term=1`. Both pages now use `resolveCurrentTermId` (KD #116); one pill per term. Same KD: `/markbook/report-cards/[studentId]` had **no role guard at all** → now `canReadReportCard` (adviser|oversight), subject teachers 404 (their card is structurally dashes), entry point is a Classroom-roster row action; drafts render flagged on the staff preview only. **(3) Parent card** (KD #165) — earlier terms' comments now ship as a NEW `earlierComments` field (never merged into `comments`: the portal reads `comments[0]`, so appending would show an earlier term under the viewed term's heading). **Note the portal reads some tables DIRECTLY as the parent** — that's why the letterhead was blank, fixed by migration 100 (`school_config` null-role SELECT). Only `school_config` + `report_card_publications` are parent-readable. **(4) Home quick actions** — `hiddenModules` was computed and then not passed on the real render path, so the dead-end narrowing was a no-op for every load (closes KD #160's deferred item (a)). 2181 tests + build clean. **Not yet done: no browser pass on the SIS side, and the adviser-only report card cannot be verified until AY2026 has form-adviser rows.** ⚠ A pre-existing flake, `__tests__/attendance/student-lookup-sheet.test.tsx` (5s timeout, ~2 in 5 full runs, passes alone) can redden CI — not caused by this batch.

**Recently landed and now stable (detail in the KDs, not here):** DataTable column display names via `meta.label` (KD #161) and the simplified CSV export (KD #162) are **on main** — both were described here as unpushed-branch work; that caveat is spent. Classroom module (KD #160) likewise shipped. Two findings from that work worth keeping: `residenceHistory` is **heterogeneously typed in prod** (JSON string from the portal/seeder, real array from the SIS edit route) so any type probe must scan every value, never the first non-null; and `csv.extraColumns` now means `defaultChecked:true` = always exported, omitted = **never**.

**Future work (deferred backlog):** late-semantics **C1** (derive the late label from earliest-enrollment across the ~8 enum sites — hardening, not a bug) + multi-interval re-enrol proration (known limitation); per-module compare trend charts (post-go-live); Sec 4 Economics card (no Sec 4 students yet); self-serve invite flow (KD #87, `/auth/setup`); attendance audit-log server-side pagination; VL bulk-import parser (KD #94); PTC digitization as a separate surface (DB tables intact, KD #114); **config-placement review** — operator-tuned settings → business module, structural config stays in SIS Admin (KD #48; clearest candidate discount-codes → Admissions; **do NOT reverse KD #118** — early-bird stays in SIS).

**Recent sprints:** full sprint-by-sprint history (Sprint 28→67 + the 2026-07 bug-hunt, KDs #63–165, migrations 030–100) lives in `docs/sprints/development-plan.md` (status snapshot at top) + `git log`. Don't duplicate it here. Sprint-60 work (KD #144/#145/#146, migration 074, pagination fixes, seeder-fidelity batch) is on prod — see the dev-plan snapshot.

## Cross-reference note

Cross-references elsewhere in the repo such as "CLAUDE.md Hard Rule #N" or "CLAUDE.md KD #N" now resolve to `.claude/rules/hard-rules.md` and `.claude/rules/key-decisions.md` respectively. Numbering is preserved across all moves. KDs were split into per-topic files under `.claude/rules/key-decisions/` (the root file is the index + KD-to-topic map); existing "KD #N" cites still resolve via the index, and global numbering is unchanged.
